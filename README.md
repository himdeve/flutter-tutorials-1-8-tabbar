# Flutter Tutorials – #1.8 – TabBar

## Introduction

Welcome to Himdeve development, where we are preparing the best tutorials to make your mobile app development easier and more efficient.

## Goal

1. In the Portfolio screen we will create 2 tabs to switch between the two subpages of the portfolio – Portfolio Tutorials and Portfolio Gallery

2. We will use components such as TabBar and TabBarView in combination with Slivers

3. Finally, we’ll learn how to use TabBar instead of combining BottomNavigationBar with a PageView component.
